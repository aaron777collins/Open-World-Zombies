# Open-World-Zombies
 A fun project to experiment with terrain generation and entity creation

- Written in Java
- Utilizes perlin noise to generate terrain

NOTE:
- The health bar does not work
- Written using bad coding practices
- Created in Eclipse
- If you import the project, you may need to rename "improvedNoise.java" to ImprovedNoise.java
- There is a menu that was being developed and it can sometimes glitch over-top of your game
- Resizing the game may break it
